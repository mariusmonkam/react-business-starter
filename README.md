## Usage

### Customizing Components

Components are located in the `src/components/common` directory. You can customize these components to meet your specific requirements.

### Configuring Pages

Use the `PageConfigurator` component to dynamically create and configure pages. Modify the `appData` object in the data file (`src/data/appData.ts`) to adjust the content and structure of each page.

### Styling

Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`. For component-specific styles, locate them in the same directory as the component.

### Example Data

Below are examples of how to structure data for different pages:

#### Home Page Sections

```json
{
  "type": "HeroSection",
  "title": "Welcome to React Business Starter",
  "subtitle": "Your journey starts here",
  "ctaText": "Get Started",
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498050108023-c5249f4df085"
}
```

#### Pricing Page Sections

```json
{
  "type": "HeroSection",
  "title": "Simple, Transparent Pricing",
  "subtitle": "Choose the plan that's right for you",
  "ctaText": "Get Started",
  "image": "https://via.placeholder.com/1080x720"
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### State Management with Redux-Toolkit

This project includes a basic setup for Redux-Toolkit to manage application state. You can find the configuration in the `src/store` directory. Follow the Redux-Toolkit documentation to learn how to expand and customize state management for your needs.

### Routing

The project uses `react-router-dom` for routing. You can configure routes in the `src/pages` directory. Each component in this directory corresponds to a different route. Adjust these routes to fit your application structure.
