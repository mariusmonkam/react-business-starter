## Usage

### Customizing Components

Components can be found in the `src/components` directory. Customize these components to meet your specific requirements.

### Configuring Pages

Utilize the `PageConfigurator` component to dynamically create pages. Modify the `appData` object in the data file to adjust the content and structure of each page.

### Styling

Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`. Component-specific styles are usually located in the same directory as the component.
