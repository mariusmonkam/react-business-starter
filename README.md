## Usage

### Customizing Components

All components are located in the `src/components` directory. You can easily customize these components to fit your specific needs.

### Configuring Pages

Use the `PageConfigurator` component to dynamically create pages. Update the `appData` object in your data file to configure the content and structure of each page.

### Styling

Global styles are defined in `src/styles/global.css`. Component-specific styles are typically co-located with their respective components.
